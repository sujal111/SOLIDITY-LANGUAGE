Time Units
Similar to currency, Solidity has time units where lowest unit is second and we can use seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks as suffix to denote time.

assert(1 seconds == 1);
assert(1 minutes == 60 seconds);
assert(1 hours == 60 minutes);
assert(1 day == 24 hours);
assert(1 week == 7 days);
